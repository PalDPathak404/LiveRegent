# Source Code (Planned)

This directory will contain the implementation of the LiveRegent agent.

Planned components:
- Pathway streaming ingestion pipelines
- Live document indexing
- Agent orchestration logic
- Reasoning and analysis modules

Implementation is intentionally deferred until the build phase of the hackathon.
